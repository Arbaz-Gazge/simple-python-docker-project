Project Overview
This project demonstrates the following key tasks:
    • Building a Docker image using a base Python 3 Linux image from Docker Hub.
    • Configuring the Docker image to include a Python web application and its dependencies.
    • Running a Docker container based on the created image.
Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:
    • Docker: Install Docker
    • Git (optional, for cloning the project): Install Git
Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:
luaCopy code
DockerPythonProject/
|-- app.py
|-- requirements.txt
|-- Dockerfile
|-- README.md
    • app.py: Python web application code (replace with your actual application code).
    • requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required by the application.
    • Dockerfile: Instructions for building the Docker image.
    • README.md: Documentation for the project.
Setting Up the Project
    1. Clone the project repository (if you haven't already):
       bashCopy code
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/DockerPythonProject.git
       cd DockerPythonProject
    2. Place your Python web application code in the project directory.
    3. Update the requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies.
Building the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the following command:
bashCopy code
docker build -t docker-python-app .
Replace docker-python-app with a suitable tag name.
Running the Docker Container
Run the Docker container based on the created image:
bashCopy code
docker run -p 8000:8000 docker-python-app
Adjust the port bindings based on your application's needs.
Testing the Application
    1. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access your application.
    2. Use tools like curl or Postman to test your web application endpoints.
    3. Ensure that the application behaves as expected.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, refer to the Troubleshooting section in the README or check the logs using:
bashCopy code
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
